# word-search-puzzle
Fun project to consolidate Ximena's coding skills

The project consists of many iterations in which Ximena will adapt to developers' real life scenarios such as creating code from scratch, improving existing code, fixing bugs, adding and improving/fixing unit tests and refactoring code in order to adapt to changing requirements. She will also practice the usage of Git.

## Iteration 0:
This iteration will set up the main Python file of the project. It will also help you familiarize with basic Git concepts.
### Requirements:
- Clone this repository
- From the `main` branch, create a new branch named `iteration-0`
- In this new branch, add the `word_search_puzzle.py` file. For now, the file should only contain a simple statement printing out the message *Welcome to the Word Search Puzzle!*
- Add the file to a commit. The commit message should have the prefix **I0** (as in iteration zero), followed by a hyphen and a description of the commit. Example: *I0 - Adding the main python file*
- Push the new branch and create a pull request from `iteration-0` to `main`.

## Iteration 1:
In this iteration we will create the first version of the puzzle, which will be a very basic one.
### Requirements:
- The puzzle should be a 5x5 fixed grid
- The words to search will be CAT, DOG, BIRD, HAT and BAT.
- The words may be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The words may be reversed.
- At least 1 word must be placed horizontally.
- At least 1 word must be placed vertically.
- At least 1 word must be placed diagonally.
- At least 1 word must be reversed.
- The list of words to find should be shown above the grid.
- Every time the program is ran, the words should appear in different positions (do not hardcode a solution).
- Words can overlap, but in 1 character only.
- As always, create a new branch from `main` for this iteration. The branch name should be `iteration-1`. Remember to keep the format `IX - Description` in commit messages, where X is the iteration number.
